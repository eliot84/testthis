##Marketing and SEO Plan
1. We plan on reaching our target audience by showing them our site on the platforms where they are already comfortable. Pinterest is one of those platforms. Every recipe and picture uploaded onto the website will be automatically uploaded to Pinterest for sharing, and we will track the performance of this by montioring the number of pins (aka shares) and saves. We also aim to grow our website following with Instagram, since food blogging is a huge industry there. We will curate a combination of hashtags for maximum viewing and exposure. In addition, we plan to run a campaign on Facebook with the keywoods "food," "healthy," "eat clean," and "lifestyle." Our campaign will run for 3 weeks with a budget of $65 per day.
