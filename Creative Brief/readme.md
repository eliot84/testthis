1.	Background Summary
The client for this website is the Little Beet food blogger. She is a personal chef and food photographer with lots of recipes that she wants to share with the public. Here is a SWOT analysis of the opportunity:
	Strengths: unique recipes, great pictures and color scheme 
	Weaknesses: difficult to develop, not a lot of experience with food websites
	Opportunities: lots of room for creativity
	Threats: many competing bloggers and sites
2.	Overview
The website is being created to showcase her recipes and share them with the public. We are designing a sleek, kitschy, eco-looking website to act as her food blog.
3.	Drivers
The goal of this project is to create an appealing website for the Little Beet to showcase her recipes with the world. The top three objectives are:
	Make pictures the focus of the site
	Easy to navigate features
	Visually appealing aesthetic
4.	Audience
The people we are trying to reach with this website are foodies, healthy lifestylers, and home-chefs. As far as demographics, we are aiming to reach women from 18-65 in upper-middle class areas, but psychographics are more important for the targeting of this website.
5.	Competitors
It’s no secret that the online food blogging is a crowded market. There are thousands of websites similar to our goal website, however our advantage is the Little Beet’s growing and loyal following. As similar as these sites may be, every recipe is unique, which leaves room for a lot of originality and creativity. Because there are so many competitors, it is important to advertise well and think outside of the box. 
6.	Tone & Message
While we are coding and programming the website, the Little Beet will be providing all of the text, including recipes, introductions, and descriptions. Her tone is natural and friendly. Some other adjectives that can be used to describe her style are colloquial, and kitschy. Audiences should think of this website not only as a virtual recipe book, but as a blog in the sense of keeping updated with food trends.
7.	Visuals
Since the purpose of this site is to showcase Little Beet’s recipes, we will be using all of her pictures. She has given us her logo, color and font preferences, and pictures.
8.	Details
We have been given an $8,000 budget to code this website. Here is a list of specific sections that were asked to be included:
	“All recipes” page
	“About me” page
9.	People
The Little Beet and her PR team will be overseeing the creation of this site. Her team has asked to be informed of our progress as we move forward. We have shared a self-updated link with them to track our progress, but will be checking in weekly as the project moves along.
