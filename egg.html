<h2>Healthy Egg Salad Sandwich</h2>
<h3> whether you're a fan of traditional egg salad or not, you'll love this bright & briny, tangy & creamy, healthy egg salad recipe!</h3>

<p> I’ve never really loved egg salad. Nice way to start a post about egg salad, right? But this isn’t just any egg salad sandwich: it’s bright from lemon, full of fresh herbs, and it gets a little briny kick from capers – it’s the best egg salad I’ve had! In fact, compared to traditional egg salads, which I feel can be a bit on the heavy side, this is light, fresh, and what I think egg salad wants to be. <p>

 <p> If you look at the picture above, you’ll see that I actually first made this egg salad vegan, using tofu instead of hard boiled eggs. I think it’s equally good both ways. Even Jack, who hates egg salad more than almost anything, devoured the vegan version. Either way, the creamy filling really shines. Scoop it between slices of whole grain bread, and this is everything I want to eat for lunch every day in the spring.</p>

<h3> <b> How to Make Egg Salad: </b> </h3>
<ul>
  <li>To make the egg salad, start by whisking together the mayo or vegan mayo, lemon juice, olive oil, Dijon mustard, garlic, turmeric, and capers. Look at that pretty turmeric swirl! </li>
  <li> Next, add the diced hard boiled eggs or cubed tofu. If you’re scared of tofu – don’t be. It mimics the texture of eggs perfectly, and since it’s nearly flavorless, it takes on all of the bright & briny flavors of the sauce.</li>
  <li>If you’re making this with eggs, gently fold them into the sauce. If you’re using tofu, mix it in and then lightly crumble it with your hands, keeping some of the cubes intact. We’re going for the texture of egg salad, not scrambled eggs.</li>
  <li> Last, stir in the dill, chives, and celery seed. Celery seed isn’t something I usually keep on hand, but Jack’s mom uses it to make her famous deviled eggs, so I thought I’d give it a go in my egg salad. You could skip it, but if you happen to have it, go for it, because it really perfects this recipe.</li>
</ul>

<p>To make my sandwiches extra springy, I assemble them with <b>watercress </b> and <b>radish slices, </b> and I top them with pretty pink <b>pickled onions.</b> Assemble and enjoy! The egg salad will keep in the fridge for <b> 3 to 5 days,</b> which makes these a perfect lunch that’s quick to assemble. </p>
