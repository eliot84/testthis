<p>Do you crave sweet foods or do you crave salty foods? I used to be someone who needed a sweet treat in the afternoon, but over the years I’ve started to lean more toward the salty side. What’s nice about sweet potato fries is that they’re a bit sweet and salty – the best of both worlds, in terms of crave-ability! Plus, they’re healthy, especially when they’re baked in the oven vs. fried.<p>

<h3> <b>Crispy Baked Sweet Potato Fries Essentials</b> </h3>
 <p> When I set out to make crisp, mouthwatering homemade sweet potato fries in the oven, I tried every tip and trick in the book. I soaked my sliced potatoes in cold water before cooking and then tossed them in cornstarch. I soaked my sliced potatoes and didn’t toss them in cornstarch. I sliced my potatoes, tossed them in cornstarch, and baked them without soaking. I salted before baking and after baking….I could keep listing variations all day, but I think you get the picture. After ample testing, here are my tips for making perfectly crispy fries at home:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Soak your sweet potato matchsticks in cold water before putting them in the oven.</b> I soaked mine for 30 minutes, but you can soak them longer if you have the time. Once soaked, make sure you dry your fries thoroughly before tossing them with oil.</li>
  <li> <b>Toss them in cornstarch.</b>This helps them become just a bit more crispy than baking them without cornstarch.</li>
  <li> <b> Don’t salt until the fries are baked.</b> Of all these tips, I found that waiting on the salt made the smallest difference in the final texture, but if you want truly crispy fries, sprinkle them with salt once they’re out of the oven.</li>
  <li> <b>Bake your fries on a metal rack on a baking sheet.</b> This allows the oven’s hot air to reach all sides of the fries, meaning that you don’t need to flip them! (If you don’t have a metal rack, flip each fry halfway through baking.)</li>
  <li> <b>on’t peel your potatoes!</b> Their skins are nutritious and help create crispy fries.</li>
  <li> <b>If you have a convection setting on your oven, now’s the time to use it.</b>Convection ovens circulate air constantly, promoting quick, even baking that will get your fries lightly browned & crisp.</li>
</ul>

<H3> <b>Prep time:</b> 20 mins <br> <b>Cook time:</b> 70 min </H3>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul> 
	<li>2 pounds sweet potatoes (about 2 large), sliced into ¼-inch sticks</li>
	<li>4 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
	<li>Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>
	<li>Sea salt, for sprinkling</li>
	<li>optional: fresh herbs, such as chopped parsley and/or cilantro</li>
	</ul>
<h3>Instructions:</h3> 
<p>1. Slice your sweet potatoes into matchsticks ¼-inch thick. Try to cut your fries to a uniform size so that they bake evenly.
<br>
2. Soak them in cold water for 30 minutes or more. Once your fries have soaked, transfer them to a kitchen towel and pat them dry. 
<br>
3. Toss them with olive oil & cornstarch. Hold the salt!
<br>
4. Place your fries on a metal rack on a baking sheet with space in between each one. If they’re too crowded, they won’t crisp up in the oven. Bake in a 450-degree oven for 30 to 38 minutes, or until nicely browned & crisp, but not burnt.
<br>
5. Remove from the oven and season generously with sea salt. Toss with fresh herbs, red pepper flakes, and serve with ketchup, mustard, or chipotle mayo, as desired.</p>
